UCI machine learning datasets: seeds and automobile. Link: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php
## INTRODUCTION
The goal of this report is to explore two multivariate data sets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, Seeds and Automobiles. Points of interest include but are not limited to, comparing multiple labels with respect to one single feature, measuring associative relations between a categorical response variable and multiple covariate features, and determining which variables are pertinent for classification. We will begin with analysis of the seeds data, containing all continuous variables, and then discuss the automobiles data set which has both categorical and continuous variables. The full report can be found in the STA 160 Midterm Jordan Brennan pdf file. **Rmarkdown Files** - The two rmd files contain the source code for the two analyses of the data sets.
